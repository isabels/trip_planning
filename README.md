#Trip Planner

##deployed at [gear-planning.herokuapp.com](gear-planning.herokuapp.com)

This app is a way for people to organize gear for climbing and outdoors trips. Each trip has a variety of items of gear to pack, and this app lets people split up group gear among themselves. Each member has the ability to assign gear to themselves or other users, and all members of a trip can refer to the trip page to get an up-to-date list of what they need to bring.

###Functionality:
*create and delete trips
*create and delete users
*add users to trips, either existing users or new users
*create and delete gear items from trips
*select gear items and assign them to a user in a trip

###Possible future functionality:
*a way to check off items after they have been packed
*a way for users to indicate if they have an item of gear, otherwise it can't be assigned to them
*changing the gear-assigning interface to be drag-and-drop

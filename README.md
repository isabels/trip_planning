#Trip Planner

##not yet deployed

This app is going to be a way for people to organize gear for climbing and outdoors trips. Each trip will have a variety of items (both personal and group gear) and each user can indicate what gear they have, so users can decide who is bringing what on the trip. It also functions as a checklist so each user can mark when they have packed a piece of gear.
